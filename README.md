Spatial Analysis focused on the Vermont Geological Survey's landslide inventory.

The up to date inventory is hosted on the Vermont Open Geodata Portal.

First steps - Test any basic spatial/geologic patterns in the distribution of inventoried landslides.
* Elevation
* Proximity to Rivers

### Training Dataset
These scripts may also help build the spatial/geologic parameters for inventoried landslides to serve as a training dataset for landslide model.
